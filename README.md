# [Capstone Project : Build an Excel Interactive Dashboard]()

### Abstract
This project is about building an Excel dashboard to track sales performance using the Sample Superstore dataset. The main goal was to give the user a clear view of key metrics—like revenue, profit, and growth—broken down by region, state, and product category. Since each region is managed by a different Head of Sales, the dashboard makes it easy to filter and compare performance during team discussions. It helps the user explore the data, understand what’s driving the numbers, and use those insights to improve sales.

### Dataset Introduction
The [Sample Superstore Dataset](https://www.wisdomaxis.com/technology/software/data/for-reports/super-stores-data-for-reports.php) contains the Orders and Returns of a retail business in the United States of America. The business has three segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office), and sells a wide range of products under the categories of furniture, office supplies, and technology. The dataset contains 9994 rows of data, with columns such as sales, quantity, discount, profit, product_name, product_ID, order_date, and the like.

### Problem Statement
The dashboard aims to answer key business questions, such as:
* Which region is raking in the the highest/lowest revenue?
* Which state(s) are the major sales drivers, or burdens?
* How does the trend of revenue growth look like on a year-on-year, month-to-month perspective?
* Which segment, categories, sub-categories are performing well relatively to their peers?
* Which sub-categories are bringing in the profits/losses?

### Process Workflow
I started by putting myself in the shoes of the person who would use the dashboard. In this case, it was someone managing the overall business who needed a clear view of performance, especially broken down by region—since each region is handled by a different Head of Sales. I thought through the questions they might ask and focused on answering the “what, when, where, why, and how” behind the numbers.
To begin, I explored the dataset to understand what it could show. From there, I identified useful metrics like revenue by region and state, year-on-year growth, and sales mix by category and sub-category.
I then created pivot tables and charts for each of these metrics, keeping the visuals simple and easy to read. Once the visuals were ready, I arranged them on the dashboard in a top-down, left-to-right layout—starting with the big picture and moving into more detailed views. This layout supports natural reading flow and helps the user process information without effort.
Next, I added slicers to allow filtering by region, segment, and category. This made it easier to focus on specific areas during team discussions.
Finally, I chose a clean, minimal theme. I kept the colors soft and consistent with the company’s branding to make the dashboard easy on the eyes and focused on the data.
